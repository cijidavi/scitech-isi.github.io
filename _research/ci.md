The NSFâ€™s Major Facilities are large, multi-user research facilities that
operate and manage sophisticated and diverse research instruments and
platforms (e.g., large telescopes, interferometers, distributed sensor
arrays) that serve a variety of scientific disciplines, from astronomy
and physics to geology and biology and beyond. At USC/ISI, the
[Cyberinfrastructure Center of Excellence (CI CoE)](https://cicoe-pilot.org)
Pilot project provides active support to CI practitioners at NSF Major
Facilities in order to accelerate the data lifecycle and ensure the
integrity and effectiveness of the cyberinfrastructure upon which research
and discovery depends. Additionally, we have explored the value of CI in
the broader societal context of how people and the facilities perceive
and respond to major disruptive events (e.g.,
[global pandemic](https://ci4resilience.org)).
