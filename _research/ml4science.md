The imminent arrival of data-oriented and machine learning-based analysis modalities
employed by researchers has created a number of exciting new research challenges for
the scientific computing research community. Workflows are increasingly composed of
various types of tasks such as long-running machine learning model training, short
machine learning inference, and multi-node simulations, among others. Machine learning
(ML) workflows are structured differently from traditional workflow applications
(typically described as directed-acyclic-graphs) in the sense that they feature
feedback loops (i.e., iterative patterns) and usually exhibit a more dynamic behavior.
We are in the midst of exploring how we can improve Pegasus to better support such
ML-empowered scientific workflows.
