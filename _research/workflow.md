Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing, and they have underpinned some of the most
significant discoveries of the last decade (e.g., first detection of gravitational waves from colliding black holes,
the discovery of the Higgs boson, etc.). Workflows are a keystone component for enabling reproducibility at scale by
automating data movement, computation, data processing, and deployment of the software stack. These discoveries and
emerging opportunities are in part a result of decades of research and development of the [Pegasus workflow
management system](https://pegasus.isi.edu), and community engagement to support the sciences.
