- title: 'Reproducibility and Cyberinfrastructure for Computational and Data-Enabled Science'
  description: This project seeks to improve understanding of how the scientific community can adapt to the increasing use of computing and large-scale data resources. One challenge is ensuring that computational results -such as those from simulations- are "reproducible", that is, the same results areobtained when one re-uses the same input data, methods, software and analysis conditions. In 2019, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) issued a report on "Reproducibility and Replication in Science" with a series of recommendations. The project will assess the implications of these recommendations on the scientific discovery process for computationally and data-enabled research.
