                    The Science Automation Technologies Research Group <a href="https://scitech.group/" target="_blank"><strong>SciTech</strong></a> at the USC Information Sciences Institute aims to empower the scientific community by conducting research and software development in the area of automation of scientific computing, providing tools such as workflow management systems like <a href="https://pegasus.isi.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Pegasus</strong></a>. As a result, scientists can focus on their research questions, while our open-source tools provide the computational foundations to seamlessly run their experiments and analyses in local and distributed resources. Our areas of focus are workflow management systems, resource scheduling and provisioning, cyberinfrastructure management and deployment, applied machine learning, and modeling and simulation of distributed computing systems.

                    In the past academic year, the SciTech Group has included a number of MS and undergraduate students and we
                    wanted to provide a forum for them to publicize the work they have been doing. Therefore, SciTech
                    has partnered with our colleagues from <a href="https://www.ttu.edu" target="_blank"><strong>Texas Tech
                    University</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.nd.edu" target="_blank"><strong>University of
                    Notre Dame</strong></a> to hold a forum for students where scholarly and creative work by students
                    will be showcased to the community. We call this get together the SciTech & Friends Research Symposium.
