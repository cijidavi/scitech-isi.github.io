                    The Science Automation Technologies Research Group (SciTech) at the USC Information Sciences
                    Institute aims to empower the scientific community by tightening the relations between the domain
                    scientists and current computational resources. As a result, scientists can focus on their research
                    questions, while our open-source tools provide the computational foundations to seamlessly run their
                    experiments and analyses in local and distributed resources. Our areas of focus are Workflow
                    Management Systems, Enhancing National Cyberinfrastructure, Machine Learning, and Modeling and
                    Simulation of Distributed Computing Systems.

                    In the past academic year, SciTech has included a number of MS and undergraduate students and we
                    wanted to provide a forum for them to publicize the work they have been doing. Therefore, SciTech
                    has partnered with <a href="https://www.ttu.edu" target="_blank"><strong>Texas Tech
                    University</strong></a> and the <a href="https://www.nd.edu" target="_blank"><strong>University of
                    Notre Dame</strong></a> to hold a forum for students where scholarly and creative work by students
                    will be showcased to the community called the SciTech & Friends Research Symposium.
