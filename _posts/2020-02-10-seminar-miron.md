For more than 15 years, the Open Science Grid (OSG) has been offering the science 
community a fabric of distributed High Throughput Computing (dHTC) services. In 
close collaboration with science and campus communities as well as resource and 
software providers, the OSG has been enhancing the computational throughput of a 
wide spectrum of research effort – from single investigator groups to the largest 
science endeavors. As the role High Throughput Computing (HTC) plays in scientific 
discovery is rapidly expending and the research computing landscape is evolving, 
the OSG distributed services have to adapt and expend. We will review the principals 
and software technologies that underpin these services and will discuss current 
development and implementation efforts. These include among others capability based 
access control and automation of resource provisioning.

## Bio:

Miron Livny received a B.Sc. degree in Physics and Mathematics in 1975 from the Hebrew University and M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1978 and 1984, respectively. Since 1983 he has been on the Computer Sciences Department faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is currently the John P. Morgridge Professor of Computer Science, the director of the Center for High Throughput Computing (CHTC), is leading the HTCondor project and serves as the principal investigator and technical director of the Open Science Grid (OSG). He is a member of the scientific leadership team of the Morgridge Institute of Research where he is leading the Software Assurance Market Place (SWAMP) project and is serving as the Chief Technology Officer of the Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery.

Dr. Livny’s research focuses on distributed processing and data management systems and involves close collaboration with researchers from a wide spectrum of disciplines. He pioneered the area of High Throughput Computing (HTC) and developed frameworks and software tools that have been widely adopted by academic and commercial organizations around the world.
