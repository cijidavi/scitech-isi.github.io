The Science Automation Technologies Research Group SciTech at the [USC 
Information Sciences Institute](http://isi.edu) aims to empower the 
scientific community by conducting research and software development 
in the area of automation of scientific computing, providing tools such 
as workflow management systems like [Pegasus](https://pegasus.isi.edu). 
As a result, scientists can focus on their research questions, while 
our open-source tools provide the computational foundations to 
seamlessly run their experiments and analyses in local and distributed 
resources. In addition to workflow management, SciTech conducts research 
in resource scheduling and provisioning, cyberinfrastructure management 
and deployment, applied machine learning, and modeling and simulation 
of distributed computing systems. SciTech research is funded by the 
National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy, and the 
National Institutes of Health.

In the past academic year, the SciTech Group has included a number of 
Master's and undergraduate students. This "SciTech and Friends Research 
Symposium" aimed to provide a forum for students to publicize their 
work.  SciTech is lead by Research Professor and Research Director Ewa 
Deelman. Her group collaborates with a number of diverse researchers 
and for this Symposium she partnered with her colleagues [Prof. Kerk 
Kee](http://www.ekerk.com) from Texas Tech University and [Prof. Charles 
Vardeman](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/charles-vardeman/) from the 
University of Notre Dame.  The "SciTech and Friends Research Symposium" 
showcases the scholarly work of students from the three groups.

The Symposium was organized by the SciTech's Project Manager, Wendy 
Whitcup, with the support from Research Assistant Professor Rafael 
Ferreira da Silva (Research Lead at SciTech). The event was held 
virtually on May 12 and 13, 2021, and included 36 participants: 
undergraduate and graduate students from the three universities as 
well as researchers and professors from the community. A total of 16 
students (1 high-school, 1 undergraduate, 3 MS, and 11 PhD) from the 
three universities presented their work, and provided a research 
abstract published in the following report:
